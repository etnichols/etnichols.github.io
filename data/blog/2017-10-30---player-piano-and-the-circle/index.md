What's the purpose of this post? Sharing some thoughts on Player Piano and The Circle, some things I liked about each, and some similarities I saw between the two works, and tips of the hat to the old dystopian novels.

I read "Player Piano," Kurt Vonnegut's ___ novel, and immediately followed that up with "The Circle" by Dave Eggers. I wanted to share a few thoughts on each and some similarities I saw between the two works. I'm going to jump around a lot here, mainly commenting on sections I had highlighted from each work.

First, a quick overview of each.

Published in 1952, Player Piano is Vonnegut's debut novel. The story follows Paul Proteus, a factory manager for the Illium Works, and his gradual disillusionment with the the highly automated society he helps lead. In typical Vonnegut fashion, the work is highly satirical and darkly comedic, and examines the impact of technological innovation on society. It's dystopian, but not to the level of "Brave New World" or "Fahrenheit 451" ("Believably dystopian?").

The Circle is a 2013 novel by Dave Eggers that follows Mae Holland, a recent college graduate who gets a job at "The Circle," a massive, Google/Facebook-esque tech company. Similar to Player Piano, the story follows Mae as she rises through the ranks of the Circle and finds herself deeper and more inextricably involved in the aggressively transparent and "always-connected" mission of the Circle.

Here are some similarities I saw between the two.

In Player Piano, all citizens' employment is determined by how they score on aptitude tests. Think of a nationwide, mandatory ACT test. The scores for all citizens are public record -- "irrecovably immutable," as Vonnegut says. Paul was able to become an engineer because of his scores, and others who don't score so well are mandated to work blue collar jobs like waste management and construction. Now let's turn to a section in the Circle, where Mae is touring The Circle's facilities and talks to a team of engineers working on a new product for the nation's education system. The product enables teachers and parents to view a live-ranking of all their students in a school. Every test, quiz and attendance check is immutably recorded and made public, and contributes to a students' overall ranking at the class.

I thought these were interesting parallels -- two distinct takes on a totally public approach to aptitude testing. They both sound good in theory, right? What better way to remove subjectivity from choosing who should work where, and who should get into certain schools? Eh. I don't know. It scares the shit out of me, really. The total transparency seems to go against the very foundation of our constitution -- our rights to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. This seems to say, you have the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness only on the path we deem appropriate for you. Can you imagine being a kid in high school dealing with everything you've ever done on the public record? Going into a college interview and the recruiter says, "Evan, your junior year you were caught smoking your Juul in the bathroom multiple times during Art History, do you not value that subject? Why would you skip that class?" The idea of total accountability for students who are supposed to just be learning about the concepts of accountability seems utterly insane to me.

Here's the big thing I took away from both "Player Piano" and "The Circle:" we have a relationship with technology, both on a personal level and a societal level. We get to choose when, and how much, we want to share, or participate in this social media circus. Both works seem to examine what happens when that relationship gets slanted out of our control. In Player Piano, Vonnegut looks at


The Circle,

Here are some things I liked about it.

p. 74 "All his aptitude-test grades were on it, irrevocably, immutable, and the card knew best." Achievement and Aptitude Profile. Similarties here to the shit in the circle, where they do live-rankings of students, every test, quiz, attendance check.

p. 70 Gold, American fixer-upper paradise, "men are worth something" but nonetheless still working on a machine.

p. 160 I like to think Vonnegut challenged himself to write as long a sentence as possible, with it still being readable and beautiful.

p. 241 Vonnegut gets meta and writes about writers. He did this in Slaughterhouse Five, too, reference that Reddit post.

p. 175 Feeling needed and useful are the foundation of self-respect.

p. 257 "How I feel sometimes"

p. 279, p. 128, p. 238 Our job is to open new doors at the processing of civilization. That's what the engineer, the manager does.

p. 203 everything's promotion.

p. 269 HARD WORK

p. 215 It hurts a man to be forgotten.

p. 243 Dog Story of the month = Instagram

p. 260 IQ = <IDK>

The first industrial revolution devalued muscle
The second industrial revolution devalued routine mental work
The third industrial revolution devalued thinking.

p. 236 Choose a path

The Gottwald house, the nostalgic, iconic American farm life, glorified because of its antiquity, much like Owne Wilson's obsession with the past in Midnight in Paris.

The Shah of Bratpuhr as the medium for an honest take on society. Takaru. "In the Shah's land there are one elite and takaru."

p. 327 Not all machines are bad

Fred Berringer and Checker Charley, Finnerty seeing loose wire and not doing anything about it -- not giving it that power. Not enabling it.

p. 332 "Most fascinating game there is, keeping things from staying the way they are."

p. 315 The main business of humanity is to do a good job of being humans beings," said Paul, "Not to serve as appendages to machines, institutions, and systems."

p. 341 Forward march. This isn't the end you know, nothing is, nothing ever will be -- Not even Judgement Day.

Wow. That was really powerful stuff.

I liked the analogy of the deep sea creatures to the Circle itself. And
I saw it really as a comparison to Bailey and Stenton. Reminded me of a
Wozniak/Jobs dynamic. Bailey as the wide-eyed dreamer who sees
"connecting all souls" as his duty to humanity, his rapture. And Stenton as
the ruthless capitalist who monetizes the technology and sees its potential as
a way to control politics. It's funny how technology has a penchant for
attracting those two types of personalities.

Cliche time: technology is a double-edged sword. We forfeit personal data
to companies for services we see as a necessity. Facebook/Instagram and Google have a
fucking treasure trove of data on every single one of its users.

"If the service is free, it means you're the product."

Reminder to myself to look up Instagram's terms of use policy.

The part where Mercer is getting chased on the highway reminds me so much of the
chase scene between Montag and "The Hound" near the end of Fahrenheit 451.
And, after consulting sparknotes to refresh my memory, I found this:

"As Montag continues to run toward the river, he hears an announcement on his
Seashell radio telling everyone to get up and look out their doors and windows
for him on the count of ten."

Whoa, like totally similar to the scene with Soulsearch. And it's
interesting, in 451 they end up finding a scapegoat to replace Montag, to
make it look like the government had avenged some horrible crime.

Mae forces Mercer to be the scapegoat for the "isolationists" when she refuses
to call off the search. That entire scene... gave me the chills. Because
The irony of it all: Mercer literally getting friended to death. A friendly
21st century witch hunt.

I often feel this duality between my personal feelings on technology and the
fact that I work for a massive technology company. I like developing cool and
helpful products. I don't think technology should be involved in every aspect
of our lives

Back to the Circle though, for a few more comparisons.

Mercer also seems like John the Savage from Brave New World. He is, briefly,
the "entertaining weirdo" for the tech-minded masses. Near the end of Brave
New World, John moves to an isolated tower and self-flagellates and generally
become a spectacle for people again. When Lenina comes and visits, he attacks
her with a whip, and the crowd gets sexually aroused and boom, orgy. He kills
himself the next day for having participated rage-fueled sexcapades and hangs
himself.

Mercer seems similar. But instead of even giving in, he chooses to kill
himself as a protest almost. Mercer, obvi, the symbol the death of the age of
privacy.

And it's not like Mercer didn't have an online presence, or was inherently
against technology. He just wanted balance. And he didn't want the love or
attention of every single person in the world.

Which brings me to Mae's parents. That dinner scene, after Mae has gone
transparent and her parents are explaining how exhausted they are after trying
to respond to every single person who sent them good wishes, is telling.

People getting pissed that her parents didn't respond and immediately being
like "wow, no response, just trying to help, jeez."

When all of humanity tries to give you a hug, it's really easy to get
smothered. 'Smothered by humanity,' I like that.

And I love Eggers using the "smiles" and "frowns" stuff. Like sending "frowns"
to rebel militant groups as a way to raise awareness. It's empty, and reading
here makes it look so silly.

To bring it back to reality: technology has made it easier to make real
impact. To raise real money (Text 99999 to this number to raise $5 for
Hurrican Harvey victims. ALS Ice Bucket Challenge. The stuff works).

When Mae's boss gets angry at her for not joining or posting in an MS help
group. Participation should never be mandatory. And this is a tough one
because it really seems like Mae could benefit from some of these groups. But
I hate the fact that it would be forced upon her.

------------------------------

The issues we face about automation and the role of technology aren't new, but are amplified by the social-media drenched society we live in today. As with everything in life, it takes a balance. And it takes self-awareness, and mindfulness, and patience. To steal Vonnegut's metaphor. It's so easy to follow the engineers and managers blindly through the doors they open for us, just because it's into a room we've never seen before. But I think we need to be mindful in the way we do this, and remember the price we all pay for each door we choose to open. We pay in the form of our time, our happiness, our attention -- ultimately, our perception of the world. If we choose to view the world through the hyper-catered lense, I think we start to lose our touch with the rest of humanity. We're drawn to echo chambers like the sirens of titan.

And I'm going to expand on a scene of Vonnegut's that really resonated with me. At the end of the novel, after the uprising, when the city is in Ashes. People are rebuilding the Orange-O machine. Which was this shitty orange juice drink. "Wood pulp, water and orange food dye," Vonnegut called it. And yet, people are obsessed with fixing the machine. _They want it to be fixed._ And Bud Calhoun, a symbol of the brilliant but daft engineer, is at the helm, leading the charge to get the the thing working again. The same guy who was, just last week, building designs for a vehicle that could breach the walls of the Ilium Works. He's representative of the raw desire to just fucking fix, fucking build, fucking create, seemingly without care for outstaning circumstances of the situation.

But back to the Orange-O. People like machines that provide things for them. Not take stuff away. Stuff that maintains humanity, their sense of self. So the question in the next years will be. Can we maintain our humanity in the midst of endless, seemingly free offerings, to augment our experience of it? And will people be able to adopt to new technologies when displaced by new shit? Hopefully so.

Be cognizant of the price of admission when you choose to follow someone through a new door.

"The main business of humanity is to do a good job of being humans beings," said Paul, "Not to serve as appendages to machines, institutions, and systems."
