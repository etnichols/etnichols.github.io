Software Engineer and tech debt wrangler at [Interact](https://www.tryinteract.com/), working on integrating assistive AI into online quiz creation.

Prior to that, I worked at Google on [Assignments](https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/workspace-for-education/assignments/) and [Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

Outside of software, I'm an avid runner, average cook, amateur slackliner, aspiring plant dad and annoying Kansas City sports fan.
