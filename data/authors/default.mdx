I'm a software engineer at [Interact](https://www.tryinteract.com/), working on a large scale refactor of the core quiz builder application and dashboard.

Prior, I worked at Google from 2017-2023 on [Assignments](https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/workspace-for-education/assignments/) and [Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/).

Outside of software world, I'm an avid runner, average cook, occasional writer, amateur slackliner, and a shameless Kansas City sports fan.
