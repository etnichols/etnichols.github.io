This post isn’t exhaustive; it’s more of a smattering of learnings as I tried to “productionize” the app, which now lives at <a href=\"https://quotebook.xyz/\">https://quotebook.xyz/</a>.</p>\n<p>In its current form, the site is a Next.js app, deployed on Google Cloud Run as a docker container. A Prisma-generated ORM sits between the app and a PostgreSQL database, also hosted on Google Cloud SQL.</p>\n<h3 id=\"local-development\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#local-development\" aria-label=\"local development permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Local development</h3>\n<p>I modified the out-of-the-box package.json scripts to include usage of dotenv, to be able to test local and prod instances.</p>\n<h3 id=\"dockerfile\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#dockerfile\" aria-label=\"dockerfile permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Dockerfile</h3>\n<p>Nothing special here, aside from the usage of dotenv to ensure usage of a <code class=\"language-text\">.env.dev</code> config file.</p>","timeToRead":1,"tableOfContents":"<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/programming/nextjs-with-docker-and-prisma/#local-development\">Local development</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/programming/nextjs-with-docker-and-prisma/#dockerfile\">Dockerfile</a></li>\n</ul>","fields":{"tagSlugs":["/tags/next-js/","/tags/docker/","/tags/prisma/"]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Next.js with Prisma, Docker and Google Cloud Run","tags":["NextJS","Docker","Prisma"],"date":"2022-08-28T00:12:03.000Z"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/programming/nextjs-with-docker-and-prisma"}}}
