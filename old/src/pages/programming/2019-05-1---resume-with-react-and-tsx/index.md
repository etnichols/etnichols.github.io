## Overview
This tutorial illustrates how to create a simple, responsive resume page for your personal website using Gatsby, Typescript and React function components. It assumes a basic knowledge of these three technologies. If that's not the case, check out these references before getting started:

- [Set up your Gatsby development environment](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-zero/).
- [Typescript in 5 minutes](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html)
- [React Docs - Function and Class Components](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html#function-and-class-components)

## Demo
[gatsby-typescript-resume.surge.sh](http://gatsby-typescript-resume.surge.sh/resume/)

Source code available [here](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume).

## Set up boilerplate Gatsby site

Kick things off by creating a new Gatsby site using the `gatsby-cli` tool.

```bash
$ gatsby new typescript-resume
```

## Enable Typescript

After the install script finishes, `cd` into the project directory and run `gatsby-develop` to run the site locally. After it finishes building, navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser to see the boilerplate starter site.

Gatsby provides drop-in support for Typescript via [gatsby-plugin-typescript](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-typescript/). Let's add this to the site. From the project directory, run:

```bash
$ npm i gatsby-plugin-typescript
```

And modify your `gatsby-config.js` to include the plugin:

```
module.exports = {
  // ...,
  plugins: [...`gatsby-plugin-typescript`],
}
```

That's it! Now you can use files with a `.tsx` extension in your project.

## Create /resume route for your site

As the Gatsby docs state:
> Any React component defined in `src/pages/*.js` will automatically become a page.

With Typescript enabled on the project, this statement can be updated to:

> Any React component defined in `src/pages/*.[js|tsx]` will automatically become a page."

*(Note: the `.tsx` extension as opposed to just `.ts`. This is because the resume page we create will use JSX, thus we want the `.tsx` extension.)*

Create a new page at `src/pages/resume.tsx` and add the following code to it:

```js
import React from 'react'

/** Responsive resume page. */
const Resume = () => (<h1>Hello, Resume!</h1>)

export default Resume
```

Let's see it in action. Run `gatsby develop` again from project directory and navigate your browser to `localhost:8000/resume`. You should see:

![Hello, Resume!](hello-resume.png)

## Typescript Primer

You probably noticed the code above isn' actually using Typescript ü§î Why did it still compile? It's because *Typescript is a typed superset of Javascript.* Which is a fancy way of saying, "All Javascript is valid Typescript, but not all Typescript is valid Javascript." Typescript simply optional static typing to the language.

This is a cool thing because it enables incremental integration of Typescript into an existing project. One could change all existing `.js` files to `.ts|.tsx` and incrementally add typings to them, or, leave all legacy `.js` files unchanged and use `.ts|.tsx` for any new files.

I digress. Back to the matter at hand: let's add some typings to Resume function component.

The syntax for adding Typescript typings is simple: `identifier : type`. A quick concrete example:

Consider three variables: `x`, `y` and `z`.

`x` and `y` are numbers, `z` is a string. Using the syntax above, the variables can be declared like this:

```tsx
const x: number = 2;
const y: number = 3;
const z: string = 'Howdy!';
```

Now, let's say we have a function, `add`, that accepts two arguments which are both numbers. The typed function definition would look like this:

```tsx
const add = (left: number, right: number) => left + right;
```

Finally, consider if we tried to use the `add` function with the following two combinations of the variables declared above:

```js
console.log(add(x,y));
console.log(add(x,z));
```

If you put all the statements in the example above into a file and tried to compile it with `tsc`, the Typescript compiler, you'd see the following error:

```
$ tsc test.ts
$ test.ts:8:7 - error TS2345: Argument of type 'string' is not assignable to parameter of type 'number'.

8 add(x,z)
```
Using the type declarations, `tsc` is smart enough to catch the invalid function call.

Side note: If you wrote the code above in plain JS, it would compile with no problem and it would output:

```js
5
'2Howdy'
```

Javascript is fun like that.

## Actually use Typescript

With that ultra-brief primer on types, let's add types to the `Resume` function component in `resume.tsx`.

To do this, we'll need to import the `FunctionComponent` type declaration from the React library. Update the import section of `resume.tsx` to be:

```tsx
import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react'
```

And now update the `Resume` function to use this type definition.

```tsx
/** Responsive resume page. */
const Resume: FunctionComponent = () => (<h1>Hello, Resume!</h1>)
```

Save and refresh the page on your browser. Ta-da! You've successfully used Typescript.

## Define types for Resume data

Consider the "shape" or a resume. It might look something like this:

![Resume illustration!](resume-sketch.png)

It consists of multiple **sections** like "work", "leadership", "education", etc. Each of those sections consists of one or more **entries** related to that section. Finally, entry consists of details like name of the position, company/organization, duration, description of responsibilities, etc.

Pretty simple, but one special case to note. Look at the "leadership" section above. It illustrates a case of a **section** with a single **entry** which is itself a list of items. Another use case for a section like this: adding a "Programming languages" to the resume, where one simply lists the langauges/frameworks with which they have experience.

Generalizing the example above into a generic `section`, we get something like:

![Resume illustration!](section.png)

Let's translate those statements above into Typescript types.

### Enter: Interfaces

In Typescript, the `interface` keyword is used to declare types. The Typescript [docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/interfaces.html) provide a nice explanation of the motivation for using interfaces:

> "One of TypeScript‚Äôs core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have. This is sometimes called ‚Äúduck typing‚Äù or ‚Äústructural subtyping‚Äù. In TypeScript, interfaces fill the role of naming these types, and are a powerful way of defining contracts within your code as well as contracts with code outside of your project."

Let's define the types "top-down." We start with saying what a `Resume` is and breaking it down into sub types until we get to types that consist of all primitives.

Within the `src` directory of your Gatsby project, create a new file `resume.d.ts`. The `.d.ts` denotes a file that contains type declarations. Add the following type declarations:

```ts
export interface Resume {
  sections: [Section]
}

export interface Section {
  title: string
  entries: [Entry]
}

export interface Entry {
  title?: string
  company?: string
  duration?: Duration
  description: string | [string]
}

export interface Duration {
  start: string
  end: string
}
```

 What does this say? Exactly what we said above:

- A `Resume` is an array of `Sections`.
- A `Section` is a `title` string and an array of `Entry` objects.
- An `entry` can have a `title`, `company`, `Duration`, -- but all these fields are **optional**, hence the usage of the `?`. The `description` field is required, and it can be either a string OR an array of strings (hence the `|`).
- A duration is `start` and an `end`, both strings.

### Define a typed data object

It's time to make a `Resume` data object that implements the types defined above.

*Note: when I say "data object," I really just mean a plain ole' javascript object.*

You can define your own data object or use the dummy data from the demo site ([link](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume/blob/master/src/data/resume.ts)). Either way, be sure to define this `Resume` data object in new file located at `data/src/resume.ts` in your project.

## Create function components for each type

It can be useful to define tops in a "top down" manner, but I tend to think the opposite when it comes to actually implementing individual components. So, this section reads "bottom up", defining components for the simplest types first and composing them together until we arrive at the final `Resume` component.

### A note on CSS

The main point of this tutorial is learning Gatsby, Typescript and React -- not so much learning CSS. We will talk about one CSS rule in particular later in the tutorial, but other than that, I won't show any of the CSS for the code snippets below. Choose one of the following options to add CSS to your project:

1. Define your own styles in a `resume.css` file (in the same directory as the `resume.tsx` file) and define your own styles for each component as you go along.
2. Use the `resume.scss` and base styles from the demo site. To do this, [enable scss on the site](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-plugin-sass/) and then copy the relevant files from the demo site into your project ([here](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume/blob/master/src/pages/resume.scss) and [here](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume/tree/master/src/styles)).

### Import all dependencies into `resume.tsx`

In preparation for the components we'll define below, update `resume.tsx` to include the following imports:

```tsx
import { graphql, StaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

import { Duration, Entry, Resume, Section } from '../@types/resume.d.ts'
import data from '../data/resume'
import './resume.scss'

/** Responsive resume page. */
const Resume: FunctionComponent = () => (<h1>Hello, Resume!</h1>)
```

Don't worry if you don't recognize some of these components or imports. We'll talk about them later.

### Entry

Let's define the `RenderEntry` component -- a single entry in a section. Add the following function component to `resume.tsx`.

```tsx{numberLines: true}
/** A single entry, either a job entry or a list of skills. */
const RenderEntry: FC<Entry> = ({
  title,
  link,
  company,
  duration,
  description,
}) => {
  const header = (
    <>
      <h4 className="job-title">{link ? <a href={link}>{title}</a> : title}</h4>
      {company && <h4 className="job-title">{company}</h4>}
      {duration && (
        <div className="duration">
          <i>{`${duration.start} - ${duration.end}`}</i>
        </div>
      )}
    </>
  )

  const body = Array.isArray(description) ? (
    <ul className="languages">
      {description.map((item, i) => (
        <li key={`languages-${item}-${i}`}>{item}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  ) : (
    description
  )

  return (
    <div className="job">
      {header}
      <div className="description">{body}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

The first section creates a React [fragment](https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html) for the entry header. It includes an "maybe linked" title by using the ternary operator, and two [conditionally rendered](https://reactjs.org/docs/conditional-rendering.html#inline-if-with-logical--operator) sections -- company and duration -- using the logical `&&` operator.

The second section creates the entry body. It similarly using type of the `description` prop to decide whether to render the description as a list, or just a regular paragraph.

### Section

The `RenderSection` function much simpler to render. It is simply a list of entries with a title. Add the following to `resume.tsx`:

```tsx
const RenderSection: FC<Section> = ({ title, entries }) => {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2 className="section-title">{title}</h2>
      <div className="section-bar" />
      {entries.map((entry, i) => (
        <RenderEntry key={`${title}-entry-${i}`} {...entry} />
      ))}
    </section>
  )
}
```

It maps over the supplied `entries`, rendering a keyed `RenderEntry` component for each one. Note the usage of the `section` html element to give our DOM some semantic meaning.

### Resume

Update the placeholder `Resume` component we defined at the beginning of the tutorial with the following:

```tsx
const RenderResume: FC<Resume> = ({ sections }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="resume-body">
        {sections.map(section => (
          <RenderSection key={`section-${section.title}`} {...section} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Pulse Check

We've defined the main components -- `Entry`, `Section` and `Resume`. Let's render them with some real data and make sure it's working as expected. We'll do this by wrapping the resume in a `Layout` component.

Wait, what's a `Layout` component? Where did this come from?

In Gatsby, layouts represent sections of your site that you'd like to share across multiple pages, like headers and footers. You can "wrap" pages in these layouts to avoid redefining the same header and footer on each new page you add to your site.

The boilerplate code generated by `gatsby new my-project-name` includes a simple layout component; we'll use that instead of defining our own. You should already have the `Layout` component imported.

Update `resume.tsx` to match what is shown below:

```tsx{numberLines: true}
import { graphql, StaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react'
import Icon from '../components/icon'
import Layout from '../components/layout'

import { Duration, Entry, Resume, Section } from '../@types/resume.d.ts'
import data from '../data/resume'
import './resume.scss'

const Page: FunctionComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Layout>
      <RenderResume {...data} />
    </Layout>
  )
}

const RenderResume: FunctionComponent<Resume> = ({ sections }) => {
  return (
    <>
      <div className="resume-body">
        {sections.map(section => (
          <RenderSection key={`section-${section.title}`} {...section} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}

/** Renders a section, a titled list of entries. */
const RenderSection: FunctionComponent<Section> = ({ title, entries }) => {
  ...
}

/** A single entry, either a job entry or a list of skills. */
const RenderEntry: FunctionComponent<Entry> = ({
  title,
  link,
  company,
  duration,
  description,
}) => {
  ...
}

export default Page

```

Notice the addition of new top-level `Page` component, which wraps `RenderResume` in the `Layout`. Also notice that we're actually passing the `data` object via the JSX [spread](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes) operator.

Navigate to `localhost:8000/resume` to check it out. It should look similar to this:

### Title Component

Let's add the final component, the `ResumeTitle`, which makes use of some icons and the Gatsby `StaticQuery` component. It will look like this:

![Resume title illustration!](resume-title.png)

A Gatsby [StaticQuery](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/static-query/) allows components to retrieve data via GraphQL query.

Surprise: you're already using `StaticQuery` and you didn't even realize it. Let's take a look at `src/components/layout.js`:

```js
import React from 'react'
import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
import { StaticQuery, graphql } from 'gatsby'
import Link from 'gatsby-link'

import './layout.scss'

const Layout = ({ children }) => (
  <StaticQuery
    query={graphql`
      query SiteTitleQuery {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            title
          }
        }
      }
    `}
    render={data => {
      const { title } = data.site.siteMetadata
      return (
        <>
          <div className="container">
            <main>
              <Link to="/" css={{ display: `inline-block` }}>
                <h1 className="site-title">{title}</h1>
              </Link>
              <hr />
              {children}
            </main>
            <footer>
              <div>
                {`¬© ${new Date().getFullYear()} ${title}`}
              </div>
            </footer>
          </div>
        </>
      )
    }}
  />
)

Layout.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.node.isRequired,
}

export default Layout
```

The component uses a `StaticQuery` to fetch the site title from the site's metadata object. Where is this metadata? In the `gatsby-config.js` at the root of the project. Conveniently, we'll use a nearly identical query in the `ResumeTitle` component. Update the `siteMetadata` to include relevant links/contact methods which you're comfortable sharing.

```js
module.exports = {
  siteMetadata: {
    title: `Gatsby Typescript Resume`,
    description: `A simple, responsive resume using Gatsby and Typescript.`,
    author: `John Doe`,
    location: `New York, NY`,
    email: `johndoe123@gmail.com`,
    github: `https://github.com/gatsbyjs`,
    linkedin: `https://www.linkedin.com/company/gatsbyjs/`,
    medium: `https://medium.com/search?q=gatsby%20js`,
  },
  ...
}
```

Copy the `icon.tsx` and `icon.scss` files from the demo site to the `components` folder of your site. They are available [here](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume/blob/master/src/components/icon.tsx) and [here](https://github.com/e-nichols/gatsby-typescript-resume/blob/master/src/components/icon.scss).

*Note: the `Icon` component only supports email, github, linkedin and medium right now. Feel free to extend it to include other logos!*

Next, update `resume.tsx` to import the `Icon` component:

```tsx
import { graphql, StaticQuery } from 'gatsby'
import React, { FunctionComponent } from 'react'
import Icon from '../components/icon' // highlight-line
import Layout from '../components/layout'

import { Duration, Entry, Resume, Section } from '../@types/resume.d.ts'
import data from '../data/resume'
import './resume.scss'
```

And lastly, add the following component in `resume.tsx`:

```jsx{numberLines: true}
const ResumeTitle: FC<> = () => {
  return (
    <StaticQuery
      query={graphql`
        query {
          site {
            siteMetadata {
              author
              location
              description
              email
              linkedin
              github
              medium
            }
          }
        }
      `}
      render={data => {
        const {
          author,
          location,
          email,
          github,
          linkedin,
          medium,
          description,
        } = data.site.siteMetadata

        const iconsWithLinks = [
          ['email', `mailto:${email}`],
          ['github', github],
          ['linkedin', linkedin],
          ['medium', medium],
        ]

        return (
          <div className="resume-title">
          <h1 className="resume-name">{author}</h1>
          <div className="title-section-description">
            {location}
          </div>
            <div className="icon-section">
              {iconsWithLinks.map(([icon, href], i) => (
                <a key={`link-${i}`} className="link-icon" href={href}>
                  <Icon key={`link-${i}`} name={icon} />
                </a>
              ))}
            </div>
          </div>
        )
      }}
    />
  )
}
```

The StaticQuery component accepts two props: `query` (what data you want to fetch) and `render` (how to render the data). Here, we grab all relevant fields from the site metadata and use those to render the title section.

Update `RenderResume` component to use `SiteTitle`:

```jsx
const RenderResume: FunctionComponent<Resume> = ({ sections }) => {
  return (
    <>
    // highlight-next-line
      <ResumeTitle />
      <div className="resume-body">
        {sections.map(section => (
          <RenderSection key={`section-${section.title}`} {...section} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Responsive column layout via CSS

As a final step, let's make the resume layout responsive.

Consider the two main cases for laying out the sections of our resume: desktop view (large screen) and mobile view (small screen). It makes sense to use all available real estate on each screen:

![Responsive column illustration](responsive.png)

How can we do this? `column-count` and `column-width` to the stage.

`column-count` breaks an element's content into the specified number of columns, and `column-width` sets "the ideal column width in a multi-column layout." Used together, they create a responsive layout: 2 columns on large screens, one column on narrow screens.

Add the following to to `resume.css` (or `resume.scss`) file:

```css
.resume-body {
  -webkit-column-count: 2;
  -moz-column-count: 2;
  column-count: 2;
  -webkit-column-width: 256px;
  -moz-column-width: 256px;
  column-width: 256px;
  -webkit-column-rule: 1px dotted $fff;
  -moz-column-rule: 1px dotted $fff;
  column-rule: 1px dotted $fff;
}
```

Refresh the page and check out resume. It should look like this:

![Animation illustrating the responsive layout](responsive_resume.gif)

If there's enough room on screen to accommodate two columns with a minimum width of `256px`, it does so. Once that that's not possible, it switches back to a single column.

## Wrap up

That's it! You've successfully made a sleek looking resume page for your personal website by leveraging Gatsby, Typescript and React. Some closing thoughts:

- Typescript makes it easier to break down the "shape" of the data in your projects. It informs decisions on how to best break down a view into individual components.
- React function components are a succinct alternative to class-based components, and, with the introduction of `useState` hook in React 16.8, can be stateful! Additionally, the React team briefly [mentioned](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/10/07/react-v0.14.html#stateless-function-components) that they may be able to make performance optimizations on function components in the future.
- Gatsby makes it easy to spin up websites quickly because of its "plug n play" nature: there are over [1200 plugins available](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/)!
