I wanted to share this [Reddit r/bestof post][1] of a user's insightful analysis of Donald Trump's speech patterns, and this [New York Times piece][2] by Teddy Wane which further explores his speaking style and its collective effect on the nation.

Language is a beautiful thing. That can be difficult to remember when we are so regularly exposed to the "verbal floatsam" which consistently flows from Trump's sweaty lips and Twitter account. But we can choose not to communicate using those elementary, repetitive sounds bites and instead choose to use language on our own terms, with our own terms.
