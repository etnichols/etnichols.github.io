I've been doing lots of work in React and React Native lately. I put on a workshop through ACM@KU this week to share some of the knowledge I've gained using these frameworks.

[Here's a link to the Github repo.](https://github.com/e-nichols/KU-ACM-Learning-React). The presentation slides are in the "slides" folder. It covers the basics: declarative vs. imperative programming, components, props, state, render(), and a bunch of examples. Enjoy!
